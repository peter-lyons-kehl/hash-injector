# Standards and conventions

## Quality

### Tests
- Write unit tests.
- Write integration tests.

## Other standards

### Code formatting

- `cargo fmt`
- Wrapping lines to 100 characters (inspired by Rust).
- Suggest [ReWrap Revived](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dnut.rewrap-revived)
  ([dnut/Rewrap](https://github.com/dnut/Rewrap/)) for VS Code.
- Please upvote [dnut/Rewrap/issues/32](https://github.com/dnut/Rewrap/issues/32) ("Breaking
  backticked string literals containing a space").

### Mermaid graphs

Used in [README.md](./README.md). To preview use (for example):

- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid in VS Code
- https://github.com/simov/markdown-viewer in a browser
- GitHub view of your file.

## GIT and pull requests

You need to rebase your branch on current `main`.

## Other (non-technical)
### International (American) English

- We love Commonwealth/Irish... spelling - but we don't use it here.
- No high Latin either (plurals or other), so for example, for plural of "index" we don't use
  "indices", but "indexes".
